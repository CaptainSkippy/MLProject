# MLProject
Machine learning project that regresses the price of a car from several features, uses tfjs library for the ML.

Find the example at: https://captainskippy.github.io/MLProject/

To use this you will need to:
1. Upload either of the car price data sheets to index.html
2. Open the console
3. Click *Upload and Train*
4. Input data and press *Predict*

Please note there is a glitch where you'll need to retrain the model or reload the page before you can predict again, I dont know what causes it.
